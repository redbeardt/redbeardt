👋 Henlo, I'm **`redbeardt`**, often also known as just **`Redbeard`**, but y'know, those Redbeards are a dime a dozen; some disambiguation was called for. 😉

I've been gamer all my life, and a dev approximately since I came of age. That's not to say that I've been grinding away with games and programming since the age of 18. The real defining feature of my adult life has been poor mental health. Anxiety, PDD (dysthymia), depression, and anhedonia, have influenced the course of my life undescribably, and in the past couple of years the anhedonia progressed to the point that I barely play games at all anymore.

Consequently I've been a NEET for a damn long time, surviving on savings, welfare, and an anhedonic frugality that invokes a special appreciation for 💝**FOSS**💝. When you have no anticipation or experience of reward, you spend less money.

As for what actually pertains to github (code), I spend most of my waking hours working on [7 Days To Die](https://7daystodie.com/) (7DTD) mods, and Discord bots. I enjoy writing 7dtd mods a lot more than I like releasing and maintaining them, so even though I've written over a dozen small mods, I've only published one to [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/). As for contact details, I'm unsure about dropping an email here, but you can find me lurking on several gaming, modding, and mental health discord servers if you snoop around. You can easily guess one of those servers, but I'm gonna retain some mystery wrt the others. 😇

What with 7dtd being a unity game, I mostly work in **.NET C#**, and **Node.js** or **TypeScript** for the discord apps/bots. As for collaborative dev work, I haven't done any of it since my brief time in the web development industry. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Welp.. That'll do.

Be nice to yourself and others
